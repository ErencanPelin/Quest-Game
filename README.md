# Quest Game
Source code files for the game 'Quest' featured on my Itch.io page. Check out the game [here](https://erensoftworks.itch.io/quest)

Most of the code is handled in the backend using my own custom 2D gamekit package for Unity. From this repo you can see just how little extra code was required 
to create the game. If you're interested in the Game kit, you can check it out on itch.io [here](https://erensoftworks.itch.io/erens-complete-2d-gamekit-for-unity).

The code in this repo isn't the most optimised as it could be, as I had a 1 week time limit to create the game. Going forward, expect this repo to be updated with the game to include more features and optimisations.
